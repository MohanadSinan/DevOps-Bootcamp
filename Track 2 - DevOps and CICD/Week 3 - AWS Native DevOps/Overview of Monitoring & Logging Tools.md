Logstash is a server‑side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch. The Elastic Stack is the next evolution of the ELK Stack. | 1. ELK is geared to handle big data to provide crucial business insights.2. ELK is simple to use, set up and is user friendly.3.  As an open-source program, Elk is highly cost effective. | • Log management • Security monitoring and alerting • E-commerce search solutions |
